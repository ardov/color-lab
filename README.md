# Color Lab

⚠️ **This is a work in progress.** ⚠️

Expect the code in this repository to be

- 🐞 buggy
- 🤯 unreadable
- 📖 undocumented
- 🐌 suboptimal
- 🤖 overengineered
- 🤬 or even completely broken

Also "something changed" is a completely valid commit message in this land.

If you are not afraid of all of this, welcome to my color lab 🌈
